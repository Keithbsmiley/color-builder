# Color Builder
Easily build color variations of Solarized with YAML scheme definitions and ERB templates.

I'm currently using this to generate
[parsec](https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/parsec)

## Usage
    > ./build
Build all schemes

    > ./build default.yml
Build only the "default" theme

    > ./build https://awesome-schemes.com/my-scheme.yml
Build a scheme stored on some webspace.

## Templates
- iTerm 2
- Vim
- Xcode
